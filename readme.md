# 🛡️ Kubernetes SSL/TLS Certificate Automation with Cert-Manager, ACME, and Let's Encrypt 🛡️

Welcome to the Kubernetes SSL/TLS certificate automation repository using Cert-Manager, ACME, and Let's Encrypt! 🚀

## 🤔 What's This All About?

This repository is for automating the creation and management of SSL/TLS certificates using Cert-Manager, ACME, and Let's Encrypt.

## 🎯 What Exactly Are We Doing?

1. **Generate a New SSL/TLS Certificate**: Say goodbye to manual certificate generation. With just a few commands, you'll have a shiny new certificate ready to secure your applications.

2. **Utilize ClusterIssuer with Let's Encrypt**: We're leveraging the power of Let's Encrypt to issue SSL/TLS certificates. Our ClusterIssuer setup ensures seamless integration with Let's Encrypt's ACME protocol, making certificate issuance a breeze.

3. **Secure Your Ingress with SSL/TLS**: Once you've got your certificate, it's time to secure your Kubernetes Ingress. Our setup allows you to easily apply SSL/TLS encryption to your Ingress resources, ensuring secure communication with your applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Apply Certificate Configuration**: Use the following command to generate your SSL/TLS certificate:
kubectl apply -f certificate.yaml

2. **Configure ClusterIssuer**: Apply the following command to set up Let's Encrypt as your trusted certificate issuer:
kubectl apply -f clusterissuer.yaml

3. **Secure Your Ingress**: Apply the following command to apply SSL/TLS encryption to your Ingress resources:
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
